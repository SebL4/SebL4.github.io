    <td>Today for the eighth week in a row we worked on code academy. I began by finishing off taking a vacation, which I spent a lot of time on last week. Today I was adding together all the costs of a Holliday such as a plane flight and a hotel. When I had finished that I started an exercise called lists and dictionaries. Then I learnt how to create lists and number each word in the list.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week, what limited my learning was the fact that the exercises were extremely difficult. In fact they just became harder and harder. Also I had not done any of this type of code before. Fortunately, nobody accidentally completed any of my work this week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall improve my learning by reading the instructions more clearly. This will help me solve problems and complete the exercises more quickly. Therefore, I shall be able to complete more exercises which means I will earn more badges.</td>
  </tr>

Here are the badges I earned:
