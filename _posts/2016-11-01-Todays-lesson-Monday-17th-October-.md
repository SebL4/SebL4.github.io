    <td>Today I learnt by using the fuze box again. I used it to make code. This code started programmes for lots of different things. A very effective strategy was to use the instructions in a booklet to figure out what to do.

  <tr>
    <td>There was a big difficulty today. This was that I had an orthodontist appointment which meant I was only in the lesson for 20 minutes. This was a big problem, but I was still able to get some work done.
