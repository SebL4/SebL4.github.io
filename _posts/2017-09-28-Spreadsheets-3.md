    <td>For the third week in a row we learnt about spreadsheets on google sheets. Today however, we focused on discounts. We already had made our stock lists and order forms and now we had to add discounts. This meant when someone bought an item they wouldn't have been to pay full price when they bought it. Each item had a code and some had discounts. We had to design code to make the discount have an effect in the price column. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning to day was an activity that we did. It was where we had to make code to add a discount to some of our products. We had an explanation on how to do it but I was still unsure. I tried many different approaches and I eventually found one that was an if statement that said that if an item had a specific code it was have a discount. This worked apart from the fact that I found it hard to subtract.</td>

    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>To make my learning better I must once again listen to the teacher. This will help me  because if there is another difficult situation like today I might have heard the answer to the problem. Therefore, I will quicker and faster.</td>
