    <td>Today I learnt by Mr Keen telling and showing us how to improve our blogs. He told us how to insert the blog template into it. He showed some code which we put into our own blogs. This was an effective strategy because it help us improve our blogs.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that the template didn't show up in my blog. This limited my learning because it meant I couldn't do the work properly. I probably didn't read the code properly so I need to work on reading instructions with more care.

    <td>Next time, I will try and listen as well as I can so I don't miss any important information. I will also try and work faster because this was a problem for me today when I was copying the code down.
