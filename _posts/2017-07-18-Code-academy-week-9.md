    <td>Today it was my penultimate week on code academy. I continued to work on a badge called Python lists and dictionaries. On this exercises I learnt how to put words into lists and to number them. However, there was a very difficult exercise which took me half the lesson but I eventually completed it. After some good work I had completed the 100 exercises badge.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that there was one extremely difficult exercise. In fact it took about a quarter of last lesson and half of this lesson to figure out what to do. It was called maintaining order. There was a list of animals which were all given a number. In order to complete this exercise I had to insert "cobra" between “bat” and “dog” in the list. However, it was very tricky as there were several new commands which I had to use.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time when there is a difficult exercise I shall attempt to take a different approach. I shall try my best to persevere and not give up on this level. I shall do this by experimenting different ways to complete an exercise and continuing to try new approaches as well.</td>

Here are the badges I earned:
