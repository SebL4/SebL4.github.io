    <td>Today I attempted to complete the first chapter of the fuze box. I did this by reading out the instructions to my partner who would write them down. This was an efficient way of working because we could complete the task quickly.
</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When we had completed the first chapter of the fuze we began a new task which included different coloured wires. I found this very confusing and had no idea what do. This was a problem because it decreased my learning.

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time if I don't understand about the wires I will have to improve my learning. I will try and be resourceful of everything I have to try and complete the task. I will also try and notice things that will help me and I will use them to succeed.
