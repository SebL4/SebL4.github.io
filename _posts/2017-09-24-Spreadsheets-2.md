    <td>Like last week, I continued to learn about spreadsheets on Google sheets. Today we carried on making stock lists and order forms for a shop. We learnt how to find prices of an item and how to see if the quantity was good. We also found out how to add colour to the spreadsheets to make it clearer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What I struggled a lot with today was a specific piece of code which we did at the end of the lesson. It was called "Vlookup". It was a function where it looked up what was in a specific cell of the spreadsheet and put it into another cell. I found this very hard which impacted my understanding of spreadsheets.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall improve my learning by trying to listen more carefully to the teacher. If I do this, I will do this finding out more information about how to improve my work on Google sheets. This will also help me to find out how to use the Vlookup function.</td>
