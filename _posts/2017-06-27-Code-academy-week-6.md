    <td>Today I continued to learn on code academy. I began on pig Latin where I learnt how to create a pig Latin translator. I did this by using a lot of different types of code. When I had completed that and earned a badge. Then I started on a badge called functions and I managed to complete 5 exercises on it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that when I went onto codecademy, I discovered that somebody had completed 10% more of my work. This was very problematic because I was unsure of what do. I eventually decided to go onto the completed levels and try them again myself. This did work but it took me a while to remember where I got up to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall remember to logout of my account at the end of the lesson. If I do this I will not have someone get onto my account and do lots of work that I haven't even started. This will improve my learning a lot next lesson.</td>

Here are the badges I earned:
