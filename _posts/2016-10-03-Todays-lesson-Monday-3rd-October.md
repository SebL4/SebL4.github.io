  <tr>
    <td>I learnt in this lesson by having a blog. We were making sure that are blogs worked and had no mistakes. If our blog had no mistakes in our blog would be able to be displayed. 
We did this by looking through the code, which build our blog and checking if there were any errors. This was a useful strategy because it help us to find and solve problems more easily and quickly. We also spent a small amount of time  on the fuzeboxes.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There were several things that limited my learning. The main reason was that my blog had been fixed this week after an enormous error. Therefore there was nothing for me to fix in my blog. As well as this, I found it difficult to change from the fuze box computer to the normal computer with my blog on it.
