    <td>This week I learn using a website called code academy, which was the same as last week. I learnt on a programme called Python. It showed me different types of code used in Python and what they did. Then the programme told me how to used them in code. This was a good strategy because it helped me to understand many different types of code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my my learning was that some of the tasks were quite challenging and therefore I found it quite hard and it took me a long time. However, I was eventually able to complete it. However, I do need to work on trying out different strategies when a task is very hard. There were not as many limitations as last week because I knew how codecademy worked.       </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall try not to get stuck on tasks where I am struggling. I shall do this by persevering and trying different possibilities. This will help me improve my learning and make me complete a larger amount of work.</td>
