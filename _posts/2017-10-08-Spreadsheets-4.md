    <td>Today we continued to learn about spreadsheets. We focused on discounts like last week and we used this to find a total price. We used codes to decide which discount the item should have. We also did an equation which was to find out the sum of the subtotal, the discount and the delivery price. We had to use a complicated piece of code in order for this to work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that all the code was very complicated and difficult. This happened when we had to find a grand total of everything. I tried all sorts of different codes but none of them seemed to work. Eventually I found a technique which was using the Vlookup function which I had previously struggled with. Fortunately, it worked this time.</td>

    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson I shall change my approach. In today's lesson I found the answer to the work because I tried different strategies which I could find on google sheets. This made me succeed. If I can do this next time I shall succeed again.</td>
