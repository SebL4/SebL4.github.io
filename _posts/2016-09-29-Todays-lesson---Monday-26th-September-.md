Today's lesson - Monday 26th September 

How did I learn 

Today I carried on learning by using a fuze box. It was a useful resource because it allowed to try to do lots of different things and complete lots of different tasks. It let us understand lots of different ways to use it.

What limited my learning

What limited my learning was a range of different tasks as there were only a couple that we were doing. It didn't limit the range of different approaches in each task.

What will I change for next time 

Next time I will think of different approaches to the task and different ways of completing it. I will also try and put more effort into my work. I will try and push myself when working and extend my goals.
