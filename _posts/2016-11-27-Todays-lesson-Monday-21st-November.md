    <td>Today another teacher came in to teach us a lesson. I learnt by him talking to us about computational thinking. I found out about the 4 different types of computational thinking: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithms. This was an effective strategy because I learnt lots of new things and it was an interesting lesson.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that I have never learnt about computational thinking before. Therefore I slightly struggled in this lesson but I still learnt some interesting bits of information.

    <td>Next time I will try and listen as well as I can so I don't miss anything. I will also learn more. I will also start applying past knowledge to help me understand things better.
