    <td>This lesson was now our second lesson on cryptography. We carried on with the same spreadsheet as last week which was when we started to make our caesar cipher. This week we were using a formula called "concatenate" where we got all the letters from our message and put them into one word. This makes the message easier to read. We then used a left/right formula where we put the concatenated word back into the original text by picking out specific letters.</td>

    <td>Today there was a problem which was that my computer stopped working. This limited my learning because it took me a while to start working. I noticed that one of the cables in the computer wasn't plugged in. I tried to to find the socket where it needed to be plugged into. Unfortunately I couldn't. My solution was then to move to another computer but it took me a long time trying to fix the cable. </td>

    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If I wish to improve my learning I need more time to work. This will make me complete more work. I can do this by not wasting time trying to fix my computer when I can simply find another one. Or if I have the same one I shall try to look in different places for the socket.</td>
