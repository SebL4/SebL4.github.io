    <td>Today was the last lesson doing spreadsheets of the half term. This meant I had to do a lot of work. The final, thing on our spreadsheet was a profit and loss or P and L sheet. This records all the profits made by the company and the losses or the money they've spent. If you add the numbers together you find out if you have made a profit or not. Therefore, I made a profit and loss sheet for my spreadsheet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that it was the last week of the half term. Because of this, we were told to finish our spreadsheet this lesson. Furthermore, we had to create our profit and loss sheet as well. I would have done better if I had worked faster. This is what I need to work on. If I do this I can get all my work done in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson I shall improve my learning by increasing the speed of my work. Therefore, I will be able to do more work. If I do this in all lesson I will not have a ton of work to do in the last lesson of the topic.</td>
