    <td>Today was the first lesson after half term and I was continuing with codecademy. For the entire lesson I worked on "conditionals and control flow". This section was very interesting and we learned about how to make things true or false. This was a good way of learning because I learnt a lot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited the lesson was that I remained on 19% for the whole lesson. This was a massive limitation because it meant that I didn't progress very far. This was annoying considering the fact that I progressed 10% last week. However, I did complete lots of tasks and I learnt a lot. I also earned the “50 exercises” badge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson, I shall improve my learning by trying to work more speedily. If I do this I will progress further and earn more badges. When I get to a difficult exercise I will try and find all the different strategies of completing it so I can attempt to complete. I will do this by checking the hints. </td>

Here are the badges I earned:
