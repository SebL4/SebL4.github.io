    <td>This lesson I learnt by using a previous resource: the fuze box. I learnt by attempting as many different tasks as possible on the fuze box. This we used a memory stick to store our work on. This was a useful strategy because it meant that we didn't have to do the work again.

    <td>This week there was barely anything that limited my learning. The things that limited my learning on other lessons didn't occur today which was a good thing.

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by trying to push myself in lessons. I will do this by not always choosing the easy option. Instead I will try and extend my work, improve it and make it the best I can.
