    <td>Today we continued to work by using code academy. I started off on 19% but after the fact that my percentage hadn't improved last week I was eager to improve. I began at the end of a task called conditionals and control flow which I was working on last week. When I completed it I earned the badge. When I had finished that I began working on pygLatin where I started learning how to put "pig Latin" into code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was once again the difficulty of the exercises. Therefore, it took me a long time do each exercise which meant that I got a lower percentage increase. An other limitations was the fact that the instructions were complicated and therefore it took me longer to work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall make a few changes to my learning. I shall do this by try to notice explanations and clues on how to complete the task. I shall also try and check the hints more often as they can be useful when attempting an excercise.</td>
