    <td>Today was the first lesson back after a two week half term. We started a new topic called cryptography. The definition of cryptography is writing or solving codes. We therefore did this using Google sheets. We especially focused on Caesar Ciphers. This is when you change every letter of the alphabet using a key of rotation to make a code. If you wanted to right the word "the" using the key of rotation +1 you would right “uif”. We made this on a spreadsheet and made a quicker way of encoding words.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that it was the first lesson back after half term and therefore our first lesson on the topic of cryptography. Because of this I didn't know that much about it. Fortunately we had done spreadsheets last term so that helped. However, I was still unsure of how to decode and create codes using Google sheets.</td>

    <td>Next time, I may be faced with another task that I have never done before. If this happens I shall simply apply some past knowledge and some of my own knowledge to help me succeed. This will enable me to complete the task.</td>
