    <td>Today I worked on code academy with only half the class because the other half were on a trip. I began continuing to work on functions like last week. I use different commands such as if and elif to create code and print different commands. When I had completed that I earned a badge and so I began to work in the next lesson which was taking a vacation. On this lesson I learnt how to work out the prices of flights, car hire and a hotel.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was once again the fact that someone had completed 10% of the work which I had to complete. This was annoying because it meant that I forgot which exercise I was at and the exercises had already been completed. Therefore, I had to try my best to recomplete the levels. Fortunately the already completed levels only went up to the end of functions. This meant u could do the rest of the levels as normal.</td>

    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>On my next lesson I shall try and discover any problems that occur such as someone completing my work for me. If I do this I shall improve my learning and my work will improve a lot. </td>

Here are the badges I earned:
