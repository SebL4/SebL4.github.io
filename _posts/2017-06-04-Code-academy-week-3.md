    <td>Today I used code academy as my source of learning which was the same as last week. It is a good source of learning as you can learn a range of things. However, today I focuses mainly on strings. Another thing I did was creating a programme which tells you  the date and time. This helped me learn a lot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that there was a couple of small tasks that turned out to be very difficult and it took me a while to complete them. However, I eventually did after trying out different strategies. This was what limited my learning as it slowed my work down. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall improve my learning by trying to go faster on difficult tasks. I will therefore do this by looking at all the possible strategies and seeing if they work and if not I will try to find new ones. This will improve my learning by making me complete more work.</td>
