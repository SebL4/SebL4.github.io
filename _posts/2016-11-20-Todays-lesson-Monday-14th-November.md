    <td>Today I learnt by doing my work on a computer called the fuse box. I have done this many times so I knew what I had to do. I learnt by completing tasks which were shown in a booklet. We then had to put the code into the computer. Today we made a game where you have to guess a number.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that we had not used the fuse box for 4 weeks. This was a problem because I forgot how to do a few things. It didn't matter because I still successfully completed the work. This was the only thing that limited my learning however.

  <tr>
    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by trying to work faster. I will do this by improving my concentration levels. I will do this by trying to not be distracted by other people. This will help me work faster. It will also help me achieve more work.
