    <td>Today I began using an Electronics kit to aid my learning with the fuze box. An electronics kit contained several wires of different colours and sizes. On the fuze box there were several holes where you can put wires. I learnt by reading some instructions in a book which showed me where to put the wires. Using wires helped my learning and gave me a chance to learn about a different thing: wires.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that the instructions in the book were unclear. This limited my learning because it slowed down my learning which meant that i couldn't learn enough. The pictures in the book were zoomed out so it was hard to tell which of the tiny holes the wire had to go in. Therefore,  I may have got something incorrect. This could have been why the code didn't work.</td>

    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and notice patterns to improve my learning. This may improve my learning and help me find the answer. If I try and do this it will help in many ways. It will make me achieve more work.
