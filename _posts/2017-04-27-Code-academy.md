    <td>This week was my first week of IT since December. Therefore, it was my first lesson with a new teacher and a new topic. The new topic was going on website called code academy. It is a website that teaches you lots of lessons about different types of code. The part of the website which we went on is called Python. It taught me how to write code and what it does.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that code academy is a website that I had never been on before. I had not learnt any Python before either. In fact the only thing I have done which is similar to this is java script. However, this will not be a problem for much longer.</td>

    <td>What will change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and begin work faster. This is because this lesson it took me a long time to begin work. This was because we had to learn about code academy and we were told what to do before starting. Next lesson I will be able to work a lot faster because I now know what Python is and what to do.</td>
