    <td>As it was the last week of term before Christmas we played a game for the whole of the lesson. The game we played was called Lightbot. It was a coding game where put in different commands to make a robot move. The robot had to go to a blue square and put a light bulb on it to light it up. When you had lit up all the bulb you completed the level. However you had to use a limited number of commands and there were some confusing commands which made it a challenge. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Unfortunately, I has an orthodontist appointment this morning which meant that I was only in the lesson for 20 minutes. This meant that 40 minutes of learning time was missed. However, I worked very quickly in the time that I was there and I still managed to complete 13 levels which was quite a lot of work. It was a shame that I missed some of the lesson because I really enjoyed the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>There were somethings in the game which I found challenging. Therefore, I need to find ways to solve these problems. I will do this by working out all the possible approaches to solve the problem. Then I will use the approaches which I think will be most useful.
