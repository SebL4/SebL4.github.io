    <td>Today was the first week of my IT this year. I had a new classroom and a new teacher and therefore everything was slightly different. In the lesson we learnt about Google sheets. Google sheets is an application where you can create spreadsheets. To start off with we learnt how to run a shop by using to code to determine how much items cost, the quantity of the item and the profit.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning today was the fact that I had rarely come across spreadsheets before. I had seen it before but I didn't know how to use it. However, because I was able to listen to the teacher I could try my best to complete the work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by using google sheets to its full potential. If I am set a difficult task that I am unaware of how to complete I shall use Google Sheets to complete it. I shall do this by trying out different types of code.</td>
