    <td>In this lesson I learnt how to give out wages to staff in my shop. I had to make a separate spreadsheet for this. I learnt that there were two ways of setting wages which were: giving an hourly wage or giving a weekly salary. In order to do this I made code that calculated how much each person's wage should be.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What I struggled with this week was the speed of my work. There was a lot of work for me to complete in the hour of the lesson. In order to do this I needed to work quickly. Unfortunately, there were still some things at the end of the lesson which I still had to complete. Therefore, I need to be working faster.</td>

    <td>Next time I shall try and improve my learning by working faster. This is because I should have tried to work faster this lesson. I shall improve this by trying to not get distracted and to start working as soon as I have been told to.</td>
